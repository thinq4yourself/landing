I am noticing many of my brothers' and sisters’ soul gifts coming to fruition and out onto the surface like never before. We are in the time of great transformation and I am feeling uplifted knowing that more and more people are stepping into their true power and desiring to offer their gifts to the world. Weaving together our sovereign threads will enable us to reimagine and recreate human life on New Earth.

There is so much important work to do here as Gaia ascends and we have the hands and the hearts to do it! I have been asking the universe where I am most needed to serve and how - and the answer has been crystal clear. To step fully into who I AM and the gifts that I have brought for this time. 

Over the last several years, many people have been asking me the “how-to” questions about:

1. Releasing old patterns and healing old traumas and limitations
2. The distortions and implants that exist to keep us trapped in the third density reality of fear and pain and limitation
3. Multi-dimensional awakening and service

My journey of birthing Think For Yourself was a combination of nature-based rites of passages, body/mind/emotional/etheric healing work, mentors in the physical and spiritual realms, daily spiritual practice, ceremonial and self-directed shamanic journeys, support from the flow of the universe, and an amazing team of elders, guides, mentors, teachers, and peers.

I am clear that what accelerated my journey the most was receiving true and meaningful mentorship and guidance on my spiritual journey who had a relentless focus on the tenants of that journey: self-empowerment, clearing, healing, activation and manifestation.

This has allowed me, in turn, to step more fully into some of my gifts to help you to embody and share your Starseed gifts with the world at this time. 

What is a Starseed?
A Starseed is someone who has previously existed in other dimensions/planets/realities and who has incarnated on Earth at this time with a certain mission to assist humanity in its evolution. You are probably a Starseed if you have ever felt a little out of place in this societal matrix and have visions for a healthier humanity. If you are in the Starseed or sprout phase of your journey, I will help you to make big transformations in your life by helping you overcome the obstacles that are holding you back from embodying your true essence.

This session will help us uncover what we need in order to help you decide what is your path.
