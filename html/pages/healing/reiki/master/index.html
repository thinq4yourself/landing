                                    <p class="light-text">Reiki, (pronounced Ray-key) is a Japanese name consisting of 2 words Rei and Ki, with Rei – meaning “God’s Wisdom or the Higher Power” and ki – which is “Life Force Energy”. This energy flows through us all and just happens to be all around us. In essence, Reiki is a form of “spiritually guided life force energy” that is channelled through the practitioner to the recipient.</p>
                                    <p class="light-text">Reiki is a gentle but yet very powerful system of hands-on healing and is easily learned by anyone to heal themselves, others, plants, animals, present, future and past events, and so much more! Reiki helps to harmonize body, mind and spirit for yourself or anyone you want to help and is in fact one of the most powerful energies in the world.</p>

                                        <p class="light-text">The story goes that Mikao Usui discovered Reiki when he was struck in his third eye by a strong light, which came out of the darkness after a 21 day fasting meditation on Mount Kurama, imbuing him with the ability to heal.</p>
                                        <p class="light-text">Mikao Usui then experienced a sudden flash of deep understanding and suddenly realized how a particular aspect of the vital life force energy already flowing within him could easily be accessed and used for both healing and accelerating self-realization.</p>
                                        <p class="light-text">In this instance, Reiki was born.</p>

Reiki is as we know a powerful form of hands-on or distant healing, but there are many different types of energies that work differently and feel differently than Reiki.</p>
                                            <p class="light-text">Usui Reiki Ryoho is the first band of Reiki. There are actually 8 bands of Reiki and each band of Reiki is based on a higher frequency of energy that is being transmitted from source to the practitioner. </p>

                                    <p class="light-text">Learning Usui Reiki Ryoho is the first step in this process. In order for you to advance further on to other types of Reiki systems, the prerequisite is that you have to be an Usui Reiki Master to receive these systems. What this means is that your body is vibrational prepared to receive a higher frequency attunement.</p>
                                    <p class="light-text">Everyone possesses the ability of healing themselves and others. You are born with Reiki - but there are blockages that need to be first cleared from your body in order to unlock your Reiki abilities.</p>

                                            <p class="light-text">The only reason you would need to join a Reiki class is to get the full hands-on experience. However, this is going to cost you quite a bit of money if your spiritual path has led you to become a Reiki Master. Typical classes to complete your Usui Reiki Ryoho I, II, and Master level can cost $500 – $10,000 or more.</p>
                                            <p class="light-text">I believe that everyone should have the ability of healing themselves and others without having to spend a huge amount of money in the process.</p>
                                            <p class="light-text">If you feel led torwards healing yourself and others, becoming an Usui Reiki Ryoho Master is a wonderful first step to experience Universal Life force.
