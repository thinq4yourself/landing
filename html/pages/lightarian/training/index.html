                                    Lightarian Clearing is a series of six unique, simple and effective energetic activations designed to dramatically create extraordinary acceleration along your spiritual path… as you prepare yourself for higher levels of service for the coming times. Each attunement is an etheric, energetic ‘event’ which launches a particular form and level of releasing within the chakras and subtle body fields of the recipient. So, each ‘event’ triggers and etheric releasing ‘process’. Each attunement creates a ‘bleed-off time’ during which this releasing of adverse, undesired energies takes place.

                                    The inspiration and development of Lightarian Reiki began in 1997 via connections with the highest energies of Master Buddha. His intentions were, and still are, to stimulate self-empowerment of the teacher by keeping the attunement and healing process simple...therefore, no new symbols are used in Lightarian Reiki. Through intention rather than symbols, the teacher is encouraged to more effectively access the highest vibrational energies of Master Buddha while also tapping into his/her own inner power (Higher Self connection).  The simple techniques of Lightarian Reiki allow the teacher to deliver the highest available healing energies to clients and to provide powerful and effective trainings and attunements to students.

                                    Lightarian Ascension Bands are sacred levels of the higher vibrational bands of the divine Buddhic energies − here to assist as we personally enter a new phase. As we move through the eight bands of Buddhic energies, we increase our own self actualization process resulting in meaningful and joy-filled interactions. Recipients also found an increase in intuitive internal and external communications and in manifestations in their overall life path.

These seraphic groups, including Seraphim Y, Seraphim, C, Seraphim V, Seraphim Z and Seraphim K, will assist with facilitating the expansion and purification of recipients. The Purification Rings have been inspired by the Seraphim in order to work through a strong, direct link with humans to advance their spiritual development. This is an ADVANCED program given to us to help our physical beings function more efficiently in the new Earth.  It is for those that have already begun their Ascension/Descension process and choose to stay ont he earth plane at this time in history.  How do we operate in the new paradigm of 'All that Is" when we are physically designed to function in the polarities?  The Seraphim's intentions are to infuse into the energy fields of humans many of the qualities and energetic patterns which they embody to assist us in operating in a pure state of bliss.

        <div class="container content-wrapper is-medium has-text-centered is-vcentered">
            <div class="token-documentation lightarian-box is-vcentered">
                <p class="light-text">Lightarian Clearing is a series of six unique, simple and effective energetic activations designed to dramatically create extraordinary acceleration along your spiritual path… as you prepare yourself for higher levels of service for the coming times. Each attunement is an etheric, energetic ‘event’ which launches a particular form and level of releasing within the chakras and subtle body fields of the recipient. So, each ‘event’ triggers and etheric releasing ‘process’. Each attunement creates a ‘bleed-off time’ during which this releasing of adverse, undesired energies takes place.</p>
                <p class="light-text">The clearing of our energy fields is a vital part of our personal transformation and ascension process. As each of us moves along our spiritual path, the clearing of the chakras and subtle bodies takes place naturally as we experience life, while learning and growing in the process. Sometimes this process can be quite painful - and some call this the “school of hard knocks” or the University of Life. But the process can be accelerated through the use of clearing methods, such as Lightarian Clearing, to increase your rate of clearing and healing while decreasing the struggle and effort involved.</p>
                <p class="light-text">As we clear the auric field of old limiting patterns and stored energies, the chakras and subtle bodies can hold and anchor in more Light! At the Lightarian Institute we use the phrase “Having the Full Force of the Light in your Life” as a way of describing the state of being clearer and anchoring progressively more and more light into this physical plane.</p>
                <div class="divider is-centered"></div>
                <p class="light-text">The purpose of Lightarian Clearing is to accelerate this spiritual evolutionary process for the individual who is committed to raising his/her personal vibration level. Since we always focus on serving the highest and greatest purpose for the recipient of the clearing work, we find that Lightarian Clearing speeds the process along, while honoring and maintaining the holistic well-being of the client… and even making the process of clearing and healing a more joyous and graceful one!</p>
                <p class="light-text">The Lightarian Clearing program consists of 6 levels with one guided meditation each, and requires a level of commitment from you to complete the entire program. Students receive the same benefit of clearing as a client, with the added ability to, after each attunement, clear their own clients and attune their students to that level.</p>

                        The vast majority of our entire adverse etheric patterns are stored in the interwoven fabric or “tapestry” within our chakras and subtle bodies. To facilitate our clearing work, we use the term “Shadow Tapestry” to define all the adverse energetic elements that blocks us as we move along our spiritual path. So as we clear the path via our Level 1 – Path Clearing, we are simply releasing the “Shadow Tapestry”.

                        When a person is born, he/she carries along with him/her four mini chakras and the beginning of the four lower subtle bodies: (1) A physical etheric body with its energy center of the 1st chakra; (2) an emotional body with 2nd chakra; (3) a mental body with 3rd chakra; and (4) the 4th subtle body and 4th chakra where fetal belief structures are stored. These etheric energy fields bring forward into the new life of variety of strong, deeply ingrained patterns, both of a “positive” and an “adverse” nature.

                    <span class="item-content">
                        As adverse etheric patterning is progressively lifted from the individual’s energy fields via the level 1 and level 2 clearing work, a strong level of natural healing will be taking place in the physical body. These patterns require additional special attention to effect a complete clearing, thereby allowing further healing to take place. Level 3 work, focuses on the clearing of these deepest of adverse patterns stored in the form of very subtle, yet powerful energies intimately linked to the physical body. We call it the “Etheric template for the physical Body.”

                            At this advanced level, we are able to access a very unusual very subtle higher vibrational pattern which seems to pervade throughout our field, even to the highest levels of our spiritual connection back to source energies. It’s as though all levels of our energies have a very subtle distortion or out-of balance condition which “colors” their energetic structure. This “distortion” is best described as an adverse belief structure that is held at all of our levels of self and “colors” our experiences in a particular way. A special Level 5 attunement is used to clear this type of adverse energy.

                        As we anchor into this plane and create our lives here, each of us has “a point of conscious awareness” that serves as a “witnessing” into this plane of experience. A part of you is in a “witnessing” mode. It’s a little bit of distortion that is present that represents a “veil” over the witness point-like a contact lens with a little distortion or imbalance to it that creates a lack of clarity as you “see your life”. Through our veil removal technique, we assist in clearing the energy imbalance and enabling you to create a higher level of clarity. Level 6 clearing work cleans the “contact lens!”

                            <p class="light-text">Lightarian Reiki is an extremely high vibrational energy system that holds the third to Eighth vibrational bands of Reiki. The transmission of energies that comes directly from Ascended Master Buddha (not the incarnational Buddha) is at a density rating of 9.9. Ascended Masters send energies at a density rating of 10.</p>
                            <p class="light-text">The inspiration and development of Lightarian Reiki began in 1997 via connections with the highest energies of Master Buddha. His intentions were, and still are, to stimulate self-empowerment of the teacher by keeping the attunement and healing process simple…therefore, no new symbols are used in Lightarian Reiki. Through intention rather than symbols, the teacher is encouraged to more effectively access the highest vibrational energies of Master Buddha while also tapping into his/her own inner power (Higher Self connection).  The simple techniques of Lightarian Reiki allow the teacher to deliver the highest available healing energies to clients and to provide powerful and effective trainings and attunements to students.</p>

                                <p class="light-text">From Ascended Master Buddha, we have learned that there are a total of eight vibrational bands for the Reiki energy spectrum, with Lightarian Reiki occupying the six highest bands.</p>
                                <p class="light-text"><strong class="accent-text">First Band</strong>: Usui-based Reiki: These vibrational frequencies create the foundation for all Reiki energy work. After one is attuned to the Usui levels and works with those energies for awhile, an individual may feel compelled to move beyond this introductory stage….to accelerate his/her pace of spiritual growth and the raising of personal vibration.</p>
                                <p class="light-text"><strong class="primary-text">Second Band</strong>: Karuna Reiki®: As the individual feels motivated to continue to expand within Reiki, one can enter the second band of the spectrum occupied by Karuna Reiki and the Lightarian Buddhic Boost (details below).</p>
                                <p class="light-text"><strong class="secondary-text">Third - Eighth Band</strong>: Lightarian™ Reiki: Beyond the second band, there are six additional higher bands of Reiki energy, called Lightarian Reiki, which offer the most powerful healing energies available from Master Buddha.</p>

We honor the 21 day Reiki healing cycle with each level. Upon completion of each level of Lightarian Reiki: As a Practitioner, you are energetically prepared to deliver healing energies to your clients and, as a Teacher, once registered with the Institute you are fully prepared to begin training and attuning your own students.</p>

Receiving the Buddhic Boost will simply lift your vibration up to the Second Band of the Reiki energies, in preparation for receiving the higher vibrational bands of Lightarian Reiki I & II.</p>
                                            <p>The Buddhic Boost is a very simple attunement designed to vibrationally prepare you for getting started with the Lightarian Reiki Training Program.
